# radura

Radura was born quietly.  
From margins, from gestures shared without speaking.  
From unlikely proximities between art, technology, and ecological thought.  

It is not a lab, not a collective, not a fixed place.  
It is a tension — a form that takes shape through doing, and unmaking.  

Radura was born.  
And it has started to move.
