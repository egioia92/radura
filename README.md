# radura

Radura was born quietly.
From margins, from gestures shared without speaking. 
From unlikely proximities between art, technology, and ecological thought.  

It is not a lab, not a collective, not a fixed place. 
It is a tension - a form that takes shape through doing, and unmaking.  

Radura was born. 
And it has started to move.
