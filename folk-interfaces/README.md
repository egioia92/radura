> Folk Interfaces (Handing Down Is Open Source) is an open and experimental workshop that explores the interweaving of past heritage and contemporary urgencies through hybrid technological and artisanal methodologies. The project originated from the discovery of handcrafted objects in an old barn in Basilicata—forgotten artifacts that carry a dual meaning: tangible materials and symbolic testimonies of a productive culture deeply rooted in rural heritage. From these objects emerges a critical path that questions the logic of contemporary technological design, placing at its core a reflection on sustainability and the relationship between technology and cultural context.
>
> The project is grounded in a critical analysis of practices such as repair, disassembly, exaptation, and reinvention—hallmarks of the adaptive processes found in rural culture. Embracing this philosophy of creative reuse, the project transforms obsolete materials into new resources for a kind of design that resists obsolescence and linear consumption.

 **U Šcandë Pichë** (the magpie-scarer) evokes the rural practice of reuse, in which discarded materials—such as cans and plastic containers—are repurposed into functional tools. Traditionally used as wind-activated noisemakers, this interface evolves the function through a sound recognition system based on **TinyML**. 

 The device monitors the acoustic environment, analyzing sounds in real-time via a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to identify the call of the Eurasian magpie. Upon detection, an automated solenoid system triggers to deter the bird. This introduces a layer of embedded AI that allows for selective, low-power environmental monitoring—a strategy for adaptive responsiveness in smart agriculture and urban gardening.

**Hardware Stack:**
* **Intelligence:** CNN implemented on ATMega328P
* **Sensing:** MEMS Microphone
* **Actuation:** 5V Solenoid + L298N Driver
